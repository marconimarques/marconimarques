### Hi there

I have been studying the application of GenAI in a way that my interactions with it are effective, efficient, ethical, and safe.

My major focus has been: Augmentation - Humans and AI collaborating as thinking partners.

### What I share here

- **AI Collaboration**: Tools and frameworks where AI and I act as coworkers.
- **Decision Support Prototypes**: AI-powered coding assistant to develop prototypes and to integrate natural language processing to foster the democratization of decision-making tools, especially in building what-if scenarios.
- **Skills & Commands**: Custom workflows to booster productivity.

### How I have been using GenAI

I leverage Anthropic/Claude Code, and OpenAI/Codex for:
- Prototyping decision making tools integrated with natural language feature, and agent orchestration.
- Supply Chain/Logistics solutions design, and risk assessment.
- Decision framing and execution using GenAI (e.g.: strategy design, tradeoff analysis).
- Navigate supply chain/logistics projects implementing discovery-delivery tracks, and bi-weekly sprint planning.
