### Hi there

I have been studying the application of AI in a way that my interactions with it are effective, efficient, ethical, and safe.

My major focus has been: Augmentation - Humans and AI collaborating as thinking partners.

### What I Share Here

- **AI Collaboration**: Tools and frameworks where AI and I act as coworkers.
- **Decision Support Prototypes**: AI-powered coding assistant to develop prototypes and to integrate natural language processing to foster the democratization of decision-making tools, especially in building what-if scenarios.
- **Claude Skills & Commands**: Custom workflows that supercharge problem-solving.

### How I have been using GenAI

I leverage Claude/Claude Code, and Codex/ChatGPT for:
- Prototyping decision making tools integrated with natural language feature.
- Supply Chain and Logistics solutions design, and risk assessment.
- Insights and discovery from data analysis.
- Strategic scenario modeling.
- Problem solving.
